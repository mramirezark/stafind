## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Still getting AADSTS500113 error"

- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Try using `http://localhost:5678` instead of `https://localhost:5678`

### Issue: "No channels showing in dropdown"
**Solution**:
- Make sure the app has the correct permissions
- Check that admin consent was granted
- Verify the app is installed in Teams

### Issue: "Permission denied errors"
**Solution**:
- Go back to API permissions
- Make sure all required permissions are added
- Grant admin consent again

### Issue: "App not found in Teams"
**Solution**:
- The app needs to be installed in Teams
- Go to Teams ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Manage your apps ‚Üí Upload custom app
- Upload the Teams app package

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Azure app created/configured
- [ ] Redirect URI added correctly
- [ ] API permissions configured
- [ ] Admin consent granted
- [ ] Client secret created and copied
- [ ] n8n credential created
- [ ] Teams app installed (if using Teams integration)
- [ ] Workflow tested

## üöÄ Alternative: Use Webhook Instead

If you're still having issues with OAuth2, consider using the webhook approach:

1. **Replace Teams Message Trigger with Webhook node**
2. **Set webhook path**: `teams-resource-search`
3. **In Teams**: Channel ‚Üí Connectors ‚Üí Incoming Webhook
4. **Set webhook URL**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/teams-resource-search`

This is actually simpler and more reliable for this use case!

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still stuck:
1. **Check the exact error message** in n8n
2. **Verify the redirect URI** matches your n8n setup exactly
3. **Try the webhook alternative** - it's much simpler
4. **Check n8n logs** for more detailed error information
