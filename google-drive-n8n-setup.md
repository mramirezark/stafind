## üöÄ Alternative: Use OAuth2 with Your Google Account

If you prefer to use your personal Google account:

2. **Authorize with your Google account**
3. **Grant permissions** when prompted
4. **Use your personal Google Drive access**

## üìÅ Folder Structure Example

Your Google Drive folder should contain:
```
Resumes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ john-doe-resume.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jane-smith-cv.docx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mike-johnson-resume.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sarah-wilson-cv.pdf
```

## üîí Security Notes

- **Keep the JSON file secure**
- **Don't commit it to version control**
- **Use environment variables** for production
- **Rotate credentials regularly**

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. **Check the exact error message**
2. **Verify folder permissions**
3. **Test with a simple file first**
4. **Check n8n execution logs**

The service account method is recommended as it's more reliable and doesn't require user interaction!
